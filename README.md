# CoDone - codon optimization for uncommon organisms

This is small tool for predicting dna based on genome of organisms. Optimal codon selection is very specific for organism, and most of codon optimization tools only use few pre-defined organisms. This tool allows to find optimal codon biases based on entire genome of any organism.
